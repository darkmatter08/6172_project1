Our code sought to provide an efficient implementation of the algorithm given in
the project 1 handout: rotate(ab) = (a^R b^R)^R = ba, where ab is a string and R 
is the reverse operation.  In our beta, this algorithm was done at the bit level -
in any given subarray, we would swap the bits and array in pairs.  For the final,
we improved this algorithm to operate at word level.

Given a sub-bitarray containing at least 2 machine words, we swap at the word level.
Reversals are performed using a BitReversal lookup table, based on an algorithm found
at --*****LINK*****--, but extended for 64-bit words.  Reversals continue recursively on the
remaing unswapped portion of the subarry until we reach the base case of having
a bitarray lacking 2 whole machine words; here, we revert to the bit swap from the beta.

As implemented, our code has complete correctness, passing all tests used in the beta.
Our beta performance was on the order of 0.001 seconds; our final submission cut runtime
down to 76 microsoeconds on awsrun, which is within a factor of 2 of the benchmark.  
Reading annotations in perf and cachegrind proved to be difficult for improving performance,
since our branch misses were noticeably low. We additionally implemented a different lookup
algorithm, also from the Standford source; however, what was should have been a faster(5 log n)
method actually turned out to be slower than the lookup - annotations showed minimal performance
differences between the two algorithms.
