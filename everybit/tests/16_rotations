# Test partitions

# Testing 3 different sizes:
# -Byte long array
# -Array of length < byte
# -Single bit

# For each array size, we will test the following rotations:
# Negative/Positive
#	-1 rotation
#	-more than 1 rotation
#	-0 rotations
#	-Exactly bit length rotation
#	-more than bit length rotation
#	-Much more than bit length rotation
# Instructions for writing a test:
#
# t: initializes new test
# n: initializes bit array
# r: rotates bit array subset at offset, length by amount
# e: expects raw bit array value

# 0: Test 0 rotations
